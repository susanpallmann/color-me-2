This was more of an exercise to complete something rather than an attempt at anything new from a dev standpoint. Authentication, realtime database, and even this concept are all things I've worked with before, but unlike past iterations, this version is in a complete state. (I may continue to update this down the road, but it's technically usable as it currently is, which was the real goal.)
